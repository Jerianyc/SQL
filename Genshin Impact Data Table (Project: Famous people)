--In this project, you’re going to make your own table with some small set of “famous people”, then make more tables about things they do and join those to create nice human readable lists.

--For example, here are types of famous people and the questions your data could answer:

--Movie stars: What movies are they in? Are they married to each other?
--Singers: What songs did they write? Where are they from?
--Authors: What books did they write?
--Fictional characters: How are they related to other characters? What books do they show up in?
--I chose to do characters from my favorite game and create two data tables, one with basic character information and one with data essential to combat in the game so users of the database can run analysis on trends relating to what are the most common weapon and vision types in relation to character profile traits.

--To start I simply wanted a list of characters, their vision type, and whether they are a 5 star or not, as this info can help someone decide whether they want to buy a character
--To do so I join the character profile table with combat data table based on genshin_character_profile.id.

JOIN genshin_character_profile
ON genshin_character_profile.id = combat_data.character_profile_id
GROUP BY vision;

--As 5 Star characters are the most sought after character rarity, I wondered what the spread of weapons was like for them
-- I SELECT weapons, and the count of names from the character profile table, join the tables and GROUP BY weapon type in order to achieve this.

--Lastly I wanted a table that shows the spread of a certain vision type between regions, to see if there is an equal spread of a given element between region.
