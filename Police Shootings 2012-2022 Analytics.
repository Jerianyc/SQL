# For the following queries I imported a table on SQLite Studio 3 using data on Police brutality from Kaggle. You may find the data used through this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramjasmaurya/us-police-shootings-from-20152022
# Here is the query used to create the table, I then imported the .csv with the relevant data:

CREATE TABLE Police_Shootings_2015_2022 (
id INT,
name VARCHAR (255),
date DATE,
manner_of_death VARCHAR (255),
armed VARCHAR (255),
age INT,
gender VARCHAR (1),
race VARCHAR (1),
city VARCHAR (255),
state VARCHAR (2),
signs_of_mental_illness VARCHAR (255),
threat_level VARCHAR (255),
flee VARCHAR (255),
body_camera VARCHAR (255),
longitude DECIMAL(6,3),
latitude DECIMAL (6,3),
is_geocoding_exact VARCHAR (255)
);

# Then just to get a better understanding of the data, I selected all the columns and limited it to a few rows just for a quick peak:
SELECT * FROM Shootings_2015 LIMIT 10;

# Selecting tables to show the amount of cases grouped by gender, race, and state
SELECT race, COUNT(id) FROM Shootings_2015
GROUP BY race;

SELECT gender, COUNT(id) FROM Shootings_2015
GROUP BY gender;

SELECT state, COUNT(id) AS deaths FROM Shootings_2015
GROUP BY state
ORDER BY deaths desc;

# We learn through the previous query that California is the state with the highest number of cases, so I decide to devide it further by cities in California
SELECT city, COUNT(id) AS deaths FROM Shootings_2015
WHERE state = 'CA'
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY deaths desc;

# Select the amount of cases per race where the victim showed signs of mental illness.
SELECT race, COUNT(id) AS deaths FROM Shootings_2015
WHERE signs_of_mental_illness = 'TRUE'
GROUP BY race;

# Which manner of death is most frequent?
SELECT manner_of_death,  COUNT(id) AS deaths FROM Shootings_2015
GROUP BY manner_of_death
ORDER BY deaths desc
LIMIT 1;

# If the victim was armed, what were the 3 most common types of weapon they had.
SELECT armed,  COUNT(id) AS deaths FROM Shootings_2015
GROUP BY armed
ORDER BY deaths desc
LIMIT 3;

# What is the breakdown by race of the number of people who were shot while carrying NO weapon.
SELECT race,  COUNT(id) AS deaths FROM Shootings_2015
WHERE armed = 'unarmed' 
GROUP BY race
ORDER BY deaths desc;
